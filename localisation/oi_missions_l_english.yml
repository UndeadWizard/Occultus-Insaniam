 ATL_nautean_expedition_title: "Nautean Expedition"
 ATL_nautean_expedition_desc: "The Nautean Islands to the West are of great importance to Atlanteans. If a threat from the West is to ever rise, they are going to be our first line of defense, and our local brethren is some degree of willing to cooperate."
 
 ATL_cannibal_island_title: "Cannibal Island"
 ATL_cannibal_island_desc: "The Anthropofagoi tribe rules an island with their disgusting tendency to eat human meat. It's not only a matter of security for Atlanteans, it's decency that demands us to conquer the island and cease this practice."
 
 ATL_new_world_title: "A New World?"
 ATL_new_world_desc: "It's been long since the inhabitants of the Trident have gone beyond the Nautean islands in search for more land, quite in contrast with our ancestors, who braved the Atlantic to arrive here. It's up to us to make the next great discoveries of this world, and find lands to conquer!"
 
 ATL_second_exile_title: "The Second Exile"
 ATL_second_exile_desc: "A trend to migrate to the newly-discovered lands to the West seems to be inevitable. Many call it the second wave of exiles. Perhaps it's best that we ensure that these settlers are cooperating properly and loyal to us."
 
 ATL_closing_the_atlantic_title: "Closing the Atlantic"
 ATL_closing_the_atlantic_desc: "Conquering the island of Antillia will ensure our dominion over the Atlantic Ocean is uncontested. Once completed, we will be able to demand tolls from foreigners, close it down to enemies, and generall use it as a political and economic weapon."
 
 ATL_the_pride_of_atlantis_title: "The Pride of Atlantis"
 ATL_the_pride_of_atlantis_desc: "Imperative is our need to control the oceans, for it is both our main source of food and means of transportation. Any remotely serious Atlantean state needs a fierce navy to back it's interests."
 
 ATL_island_presence_title: "Island Presence"
 ATL_island_presence_desc: "The islands in the Trident Gulf are excellent defensive chokepoints and economic hubs. In order to strengthen our ambitions, subdueing one of the islands will guarantee our presence in the naval routes of the Gulf."
 
 ATL_reclaim_the_islands_title: "Reclaim the Islands"
 ATL_reclaim_the_islands_desc: "Every island off our coast that isn't under our control is a major liability. Whether it is piracy, rival warlords or foreign influence, their importance cannot be underestimated. We ought to control every single one of them to ensure our survival."
 
 ATL_strengthen_the_army_title: "Strengthen the Army"
 ATL_strengthen_the_army_desc: "Storms, literally and figuratively, approach the Trident Gulf. As the Imperator's health worsens, Atlantis comes closer and closer to all-out civil war. Preparation is key to ensure that, if conflict reaches our borders, we will fight back - and then bring it to other borders."
 
 ATL_march_to_crownlands_title: "March to the Crownlands"
 ATL_march_to_crownlands_desc: "The Crownlands are a shadow of their former selves, but are still wealthy and densely populated, on top of their obvious symbolic importance. If we seek to conquer the whole continent, the Crownlands are a good next step."
 
 ATL_the_new_empire_title: "The New Empire"
 ATL_the_new_empire_desc: "All other lords in Atlantis are merely pretender warlords, seeking to grow their fragile positions within the continent. We shall bring them all to their knees as our inevitable rise continues. Merely proclaiming ourselves Imperator is not enough - we'll make sure everyone in Atlantis is well aware that they are our lawful subjects!"
 
 ATL_prepare_imperial_army_title: "Prepare Imperial Army"
 ATL_prepare_imperial_army_desc: "Although we are the major force in the continent and claim to be the sole rulers, the truth is that there are still those out there that oppose us. On this final step of our unification, we will need to commit the full might of our armies."
 
 ATL_reclaim_the_center_title: "Reclaim the Center"
 ATL_reclaim_the_center_desc: "While land routes are less popular for those in the inner part of the Gulf, it remains important for the cities on the other coast. Central Atlantis is key in connecting our lands and splitting our enemies for easy pickings."
 
 ATL_imperium_sine_title: "Imperium Sine Fine"
 ATL_imperium_sine_desc: "Our unification is complete. Atlantis is whole again, this time for good, we hope. Our undisputed title of Imperator is a heavy burden that we are going to assume with all of our might!"
 
 ATL_establish_hegemony_title: "Establish Hegemony"
 ATL_establish_hegemony_desc: "If we seek to be recognized as more than yet another warring state, we must secure a power base within our immediate vicinity to start our campaigns from."
 
 ATL_eliminate_rivals_title: "Eliminate Rivals"
 ATL_eliminate_rivals_desc: "Many rivals stand between us and success in our road for the unification of Atlantis. Silencing our early ones and growing our power base into a serious regional power will soften the rest of the process."
 
 ATL_reclaim_the_gate_title: "Reclaim the Gate"
 ATL_reclaim_the_gate_desc: "Both sides of the Trident Gate must be reclaimed in order to police and control the entry and exit of ships within the Trident Gulf. Being Atlantis' most important geographical feature, we can't have it any other way."
 
 ATL_peace_at_home_title: "Peace at Home"
 ATL_peace_at_home_desc: "Internal dissent and instability crashed the mighty Atlantean Empire. A hard lesson, but one we have to learn; we can't let internal strife destroy our legacy, else everything we built will be meaningless."
 
 ATL_diplomatic_priority_title: "Diplomatic Priority"
 ATL_diplomatic_priority_desc: "Most deals in Atlantis nowadays come down to temporary alliances based on immediate needs, and little long-term planning, if any. Seeking a local ally with aligned interests is important for our safety, preventing conflicts before they even start."
 
 ATL_deal_with_foreigners_title: "Deal with Foreigners"
 ATL_deal_with_foreigners_desc: "Fairly recently, European explorers have started to visit Atlantis. It's in our best interests to open up dialogue with them for now and see what the future holds."
 
 ATL_european_reforms_title: "European Reforms"
 ATL_european_reforms_desc: "It's hard to deny that there is much to learn from the Europeans. Many of us can trace our ancestry to Europe, in fact; some of their advanced knowledge and weapons could be a decisive factor in an Atlantean conflict."
 
 ATL_pathway_to_europe_title: "Pathway to Europe"
 ATL_pathway_to_europe_desc: "The Macaronesian Archipelago, originally settled by Iberians, is a key point in the Atlantic Ocean. It's close to the coast of Africa enough to threaten the Berbers, and using the coast, it's easy to reach Europe. For us, living in a largely seaborne society, they serve as an interesting strategic location."

 ATL_island_presence_tt: "It is important to secure an island within the Trident Gulf to ensure a more secured position within the Trident Gulf." 
 ANX_discover_new_lands_tt:0 "There are rumours of lands to the west from fishing boats and sailors that have strayed to far from Antillia, discovering them would certainly be a boon to our people."
