 aza_anewhope.1.d:0 "In a matter of days, Herakleios is imprisoned to his bed; A burning fever plagues him, and strange misshapen growths have begun emerging from his flesh. In fear of the affliction spreading, his council voted to quarantine their Imperator to his chambers, against Herakleios's wishes. There was only so much time left for him to change the fate of Atlantis, yet his own people conspired against him. If that wasn't enough, rumours of his illness have spread beyond his Palace, brewing a poisonous concoction of fear and rebellion among the populace. Even as he laid in his bed, the traitors who call themselves Rexes prepared to claim all of Atlantis for their Houses. The future of Atlantis looked grim, and Herakleios was powerless to stop it."

 aza_anewhope.2.t:0 "A Gamble"
 aza_anewhope.2.d:0 "With Herakleios on his deathbed, he realized there was only one that could be trusted with saving Atlantis. He and the Lord of Acens have butted heads on more than one occasion, but Aquila was a childhood friend, and loyal to a fault. If there was a man that could ensure Herakleios's successor ascends to the throne unfettered then it would be the 'Eagle of Acens'. However, there remains the issue of summoning him to his side. The council's quarantine imprisoned him in his chambers, but his Chamberlain regularly was allowed entry to give updates on the affairs of his palace. Herakleios could easily give him the summons to bring Aquila to Atlantium, but there was a nagging feeling at the back of Herakleios's mind. While the quarantine was for supposedly altruistic reasons,  it also gave unprecedented power to the council; power that wouldn't be so easily given up. An Antillian maid regularly came by to clean his chambers, he could slip the summons to her and have it delivered to a trusted outrider."

 aza_anewhope.3.t:0 "Arrival of a Lord"
 aza_anewhope.3.d:0 "In his chambers, Herakleios was isolated from the world, but he still managed to catch a rumour or two. From the scraps he gathered from his Maid, the Council is in a uproar due to the unexpected arrival of Aquila of Acens. They had barred the Lord from having an audience with Herakleios, citing that the Imperator himself was too frail and sickly to discuss matters of the realm. Herakleios's resolve was fortified, he now knew for sure that there was a conspiracy among the Council. If that was not enough, his Chamberlain also looked visibly displeased at the news of Aquila's arrival. Perhaps he is also among the conspirators?"
