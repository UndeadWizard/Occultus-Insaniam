 aza_thegrandson.1.d:0 "Over the course of the next few days Aquila led an investigation that concluded that Imperator Herakleios was not inflicted by the Red Plague but instead was poisoned by the Court Physician appointed by the Council. Council-Loyalists were promptly rounded up and executed for treason against the Crown, although many fled to neighboring Atlantean kingdoms for refugee. It was decreed by Herakleios via Aquila that Vlassis shall be the successor to the throne, which was publicly protested by the Chrysa family - who desired the Atlantean Imperatorship to go to one of their members. \nThe poison, which was no longer administered, still had taken a significant toll on Herakleios' body. Story has it that when the first light of Spring touched Atla, Herakleios died during the sunrise with a grin on his face. For despite ruling a collapsing empire and facing on seditious plot after the other, he had persevered every trial. Vlassis, now known as Imperator Vlassis, was coronated in the Grand Temple of Jupiter and anointed with the ten oils of Atlas."

 aza_thegrandson.2.t: "A Wife"
 aza_thegrandson.2.d: "Vlassis, though young, was not naive. He knew many of his vassals bore no love for him. After all, he came from the family that ruled Atlantis during the Collapse; to them he represented the old, the corrupted, and the incapable. But there was something he could do to stabilize the realm. Despite having the heart of many a maiden (among other things), he was still unmarried. This meant that,in sacrifice of his bachelorhood, he could marry one of the close relatives of the Lords of Ionmym or of Diaprepes. However, marrying one would mean making the enemy of the other."

 aza_thegrandson.3.t: "Traitor Lords"
 aza_thegrandson.3.d: "At dawn, a small detachment led by a minor Chrysa noble arrived at the gates of Atlantium. A small commotion broke out as it became increasingly clear that the Lord of Chryososes has refused to recognize the sovereignty of Imperator Vlassis, claiming that Aquila had placed him on the throne as a Acenian puppet. Even worse yet the Lord of Diaprepes has joined the Chyrsa in their treason, and both now ruling their territories as independent kings."
