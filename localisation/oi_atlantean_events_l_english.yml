 oi_discovery.1.t: "Strange Christians"
 oi_discovery.1.d: "Our explorers have sent reports of some of their latest findings in our Atlantic expeditions, and they found themselves unsure how to proceed. In a large island, they did the usual procedures for newly discovered territory: attempt communication with the locals, seek early diplomacy, restock some supplies, evangelize some. Yet, this time, they were caught offguard when they learned the locals already had a grasp on what Christianity is. \nIt turns out they follow the Heptarchic sect, or so they claim; it preaches the word of Jesus much like we do, and shares most saints and a concept of God, but does not have a central authority akin to the Papacy or the Ecumenical Patriarch; they also do not speak of Jesus as a charming pacifist, but as a grand warrior of mythological achievements. We're still unsure with how to proceed with regards to those people..."
 oi_discovery.1.a: "They're still Christian, right?"
 oi_discovery.1.b: "What is this heresy?!"
 oi_discovery.2.t: "Familiar Yet Foreign"
 oi_discovery.2.d: "Explorers from our old land in Europe have arrived at our shores, and they are eager to communicate to some extent. We had a lot to share with each other - how the political landscape of Europe has changed since our departure, how our trip and settling went. For all of our differences, it was a productive exchange that is sure to fill in history books for both of our nations.\nPerhaps most important, however, was a debate over none other than religion itself. While we share our faith in the Lord and his son Jesus Christ, it's clear that distance and time has made us very different. At times, it seemed they couldn't grasp even the basic notions of what being a Christian even is. They denied that Jesus had accomplish his twelve grand feats, for one."
 oi_discovery.2.a: "Interesting"
 oi_discovery.3.t: "Explorers From Europa"
 oi_discovery.3.d: "We've received news that explorers from Europa somehow reached our shores. It was once the homeland of many of the peoples that came to migrate to Atlantis, and pretty much the entire continent can in one way or another claim heritage to some European group. This is fantastic news, for finally we'll be able to fill in our history books with what actually happened there after the departures of the later groups from Trichotos. They seemed to be equally interested in learning from us how did we even get here, as well as how our society got to this point. A fruitful exchange, to be certain; though they seem fixated on discussing religion. The look of shock in their faces when we showed them a cross and said we were already aware of the concept of "Christianity" was certainly priceless."
 oi_discovery.3.a: "At last!"
 oi_discovery.3.b: "So how are the Romans faring?"
