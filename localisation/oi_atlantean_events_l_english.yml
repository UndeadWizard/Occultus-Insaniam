 oi_discovery.1.t: "Strange Christians"
 oi_discovery.1.d: "Our explorers have sent reports of some of their latest findings in our Atlantic expeditions, and they found themselves unsure how to proceed. In a large island, they did the usual procedures for newly discovered territory: attempt communication with the locals, seek early diplomacy, restock some supplies, evangelize some. Yet, this time, they were caught offguard when they learned the locals already had a grasp on what Christianity is. \nIt turns out they follow the Heptarchic sect, or so they claim; it preaches the word of Jesus much like we do, and shares most saints and a concept of God, but does not have a central authority akin to the Papacy or the Ecumenical Patriarch; they also do not speak of Jesus as a charming pacifist, but as a grand warrior of mythological achievements. We're still unsure with how to proceed with regards to those people..."

 oi_discovery.1.b: "What is this heresy?!"
