 aza_thecouncil.1.t:0 "Death of an Imperator"
 aza_thecouncil.1.d:0 "In the dead of night, Herakleios awoke. There was a soft dripping sound that was coming closer, and a slow creak of the floorboards. Herakleios turned to look, and saw the unmistakable figure of a man creeping towards him. Although the shadows masked their face, Herakleios recognized his family heraldry on his chest, a brazen black octopus wielding a trident. An assassin who snuck in? A guard bought to hasten his demise? Herakleios could make out a dagger in the dim light, slick with blood. Did he kill the guards in the quarantine? Is this how it ends? The man was standing over him now. Herakleios could feel a pillow be removed from under him. A feeling that could only be the finest Atlantean silk touched his face in a firm embrace. Then the rising tide of pain as his lungs struggled for air. And finally the gentle, sweet release of darkness."

 aza_thecouncil.2.t:0 "Rise of the Council"
 aza_thecouncil.2.d:0 "The sudden death of Imperator Herakleios threw the Atlantium into a state of anarchy. While there were plenty of pretenders to the throne of Atlantis, it was no simple task picking one. The wrong choice and the realm is thrown into civil war. For this reason, the head of the Council Dix Proditi self-appointed himself as the Chief Justiciar of Atlantium. However, as time went on, it became overwhelmingly clear the members of the Council had no interest in ceding power. The few remaining vassals that stayed loyal under Herakleios refused to recognize the sovereignty of the Council and seceded from the Empire. \nThe charade came to end when Dix Proditi announced the foundation of a new republic, one beholden to the interests of the people and not the elite. Council-Loyalists rounded up whichever nobles had not fled Atlantium and publicly executed them for being enemies against the state. The Argyis octopus once present throughout all the halls of Alantium were ripped down and replaced with the symbol of the Council, Daedalus' labyrinth."
