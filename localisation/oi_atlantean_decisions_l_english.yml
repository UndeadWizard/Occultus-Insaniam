 spreading_atlanic_rituals_desc: "Converting to the Atlanic religion requires nothing, every person is able to direct their own religious rituals. As long as you honor the Atlaians - Jupiter, Yamm, Haides and Juno - you are considered a follower of the Atlanic Pantheon. Let us encourage more and more of our subjects to learn of our gods so that they can at least start to worship them."
