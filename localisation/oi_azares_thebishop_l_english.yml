 aza_thebishop.1.t:0 "The Bishop"
 aza_thebishop.1.d:0 "A Holy Man wrapped in the finest Atlantean silk and speaking with an Antillian accent has been in Vlassis' court for months now preaching the word of 'God'. Some of your court has been swayed by his words and have converted to the faith of the Antillians, Heptarchicism; much to the dismay of your Priests. Some have petitioned you to exile the Heptarchics from your lands, before their influence grows too strong. While the Holy Man has approached you with an offer to teach you the specifics of his faith. Perhaps this new faith is what the Atlantean empire truly needs to be whole again?"
 aza_thebishop.1.a:0 "This foolery has gone on long enough. Begone Bishop!"
 aza_thebishop.1.b:0 "Tell me more of Jesus and his battle with Cerberus?"
 
 aza_thebishop.2.t:0 "Status of the Pagans"
 aza_thebishop.2.d:0 "Upon Vlassis' conversion to the Heptarchic faith, many of your Atlanic subjects and priests grew worried. After all their Imperator now speaks of Jesus, the Holy Virgin, and how Saint Peter and Jesus worked together to slay the Jerusalem Lion. Your newly appointed Bishop has spoken at length of how to save your subject's souls. If they do not stray from their heathenous beliefs they are doomed to Hell, a gaping abyss where the wicked and demons are punished for all of eternity. The Atlanic priests in your court however have suggested the passage of a "Freedom of Faith" decree, proposing that as long as a citizen pays their taxes they are free to worship however they please."
 aza_thebishop.2.a:0 "As long as taxes are paid, they are free to do as they wish."
 aza_thebishop.2.b:0 "To save the souls of my Empire, I require the strongest will."
