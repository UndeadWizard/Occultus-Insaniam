 aza_countryevents.1.d:0 "Imperator Herakleios stood on the balcony of his palace, surveying his once-mighty domain. Atlantium at its height was a sight to behold, but now many homes lie empty, a sullen monument to the Red Plague that ravaged the land merely decades before. Herakleios coughs, his Court Physican had swore to him days ago that the ailment wasn't anything to worry about. Yet since then he had only gotten worse. Herakleios feared for himself, and even worse yet Herakleios feared for his people."
