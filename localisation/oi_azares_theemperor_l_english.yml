 aza_theemperor.1.t: "Revitalizing Atlantium"
 aza_theemperor.1.d: "Atlantium has seen better days in the past: The canals once filled with sparkling clear water are now muddled with all kinds of filth, homes lie empty and crumbling throughout the city center, and even the Grand Palace is lined with cracks infested with overgrown vines. The ascension of Imperator Vlassis has seen a considerable rise in the power of Atlantium, but it is still not enough. A Empire cannot be built if its capital does not shine with its inherent splendor. Aquila of Acens advises that the way forward is to invite destitute farmers and their sons to live and maintain in empty homes, as well as pay them wages to act as laborers. This will cost a significant sum, but will significantly improve the infrastructure of Atlantium. Alternatively, a Aterpean merchant has proposed granting trading licences to less established merchants from the southern-republic. This will upset many of your local merchants, but end up gathering a considerable sum for your treasury."
 aza_theemperor.1.a: "I shall invite the destitute to build anew."
 aza_theemperor.1.b: "The Aterpean Merchants will be granted licences."

 aza_theemperor.2.t: "Atlantean Industry"
 aza_theemperor.2.d: "Atlantium's economy has been struggling for nearly a century. The rapid depopulation brought on by the Red Plague reduced demand for Atlantean silk to new historical lows, as most nobles have switched to wearing more dependable materials. However, with the onset of the Atlantean warlords, silk has been steadily becoming as a sign of legitimacy for their positions. While we do not publicly recognize these Warlords as truly independent, we could spend resources to expand the silk district to increase supply to fund future war efforts. Alternatively, a buck-toothed mammoth of a man by the name of Castor Nassos has proposed the reconstruction of the Atlantean gladiator pits closed decades ago under his stewardship. According to your advisers, Castor is a powerful merchant that already controls 20% of Atlantium's industry. Giving him control over the gladiator pits will certainly bring new wealth to Atlantium, but will diminish your control over its industry."
 aza_theemperor.2.a: "The traitors shall fund their demise through our silk!"
 aza_theemperor.2.b: "I look forward to a good showing by the Gladiators."

aza_theemperor.3.t: "Walls of Atlantium"
aza_theemperor.3.d: "The walls surrounding Atlantium have served as a bulwark against the Ayadoni Barbaroi before the Latin Conquest, but since then they have served more of a decoration than as a defense. Ever since the Red Plague, cracks line many of its great stones, and parts of the wall have already collapsed. With the state of the Atlantean Empire, it is arguably advantageous to repair the walls now to secure your position in Atlantium. You have also been given offers from entrepreneurial merchants wishing to reuse the wall-material to expand their existing businesses, while you'll surely benefit monetarily, rebuilding the walls in the future will be more expensive."
aza_theemperor.3.a: "The walls of Atlantium shall stand as tall as they did during the Latin Era."
aza_theemperor.3.b: "Relics of the past are better suited for the pursuit of more wealth."
