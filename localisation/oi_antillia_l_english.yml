 anx_events.1.t:0 "Future of Antillia"
 anx_events.1.d:0 "For the first time since Saint Ansis' exodus from Iberia, Antillia is united. Though the blood of many a holy man was shed to accomplish such feat, all now bow to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Loyalists throughout all of Antillia are throwing celebrations, praising the name of the "Great Uniter"  that brought peace to Antillia. New banners are being hosted all across the land, for no more is there a Ansalli or Aira; there is only Antillia. Yet there is no time for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to rest on their laurels, for there is much to still be done. \n\nThe newly established Antillian Court is divided on what path to glory Antillia will take, a debate that has raged on for months. To the south lies an untouched land of splendor, fabled to hold untold fortunes of wealth to fill our coffers. Many Priests have spoken at length about the necessity of securing colonies, if not for the silver but the safety of the Antillian homeland. Their opponents retort that to truly secure the safety of Antillia, it would be to invade the re-surging Atlantis to the north before it gets too strong and overwhelms Antillia. "
 anx_events.1.a:0 "Our settlers will plow the fields of the south!"
