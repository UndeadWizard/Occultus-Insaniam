 oi_oracle.1.t: "Legitimacy"
 oi_oracle.1.d: "The Oracle's bloody hands finally rise out of the small corpse of a young deer. [Root.Monarch.GetName], whose mind had been drifting for minutes, notices the Oracle's job is nearly done. 'Can you also see this, [Root.Monarch.GetName]?' - the Oracle starts, in a more casual tone than usual - 'This shape, it's one of a grand crown'. [Root.Monarch.GetName] notices the shape of the blood does fit in well - one of the ends is almost straight, while the other is messier, albeit maintains some cohesion, forming shapes that do look like a crown's top part. 'As clear as it could possibly be, this is a sign that even the untrained eye can recognize. The Gods approve of your rulership, the ultimate confirmation of the legitimacy of your reign.' [Root.Monarch.GetName] lets out a short, confident smile."
 oi_oracle.1.a: "Excellent news."

 oi_oracle.2.t: "Warrior"
 oi_oracle.2.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] stares attentively at the movements of the Oracle's hands, as she finishes the evisceration of a rabbit, trying as hardly as possible to keep cool despite growing impatience. Finally, in what felt like hours - despite being a matter of several minutes - the Oracle announces the deed is done, and the signs are there. 'My lord, what I see here is great news for you'; for [Root.Monarch.GetName], it's not much more than bloody gore. Yet it seems the Oracle has seen something. 'These signs are the ones we see in the great warriors of the past, kings and soldiers align. It is that of Minrva expressing her will to see your success; with divine help, there will be no foe you cannot smite.'"
 oi_oracle.2.a: "I'm not going to disappoint Minrva."

 oi_oracle.3.t: "Conqueror"
 oi_oracle.3.d: "'My lord' - the Oracle starts - 'The news I bear are certainly of your interest'. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s attention is immediately earned, yet still a cautious one at that, unsure whether to expect good or bad news. 'It's not too often that we are graced with a sign quite like this one', the Oracle continues, eyes giving equal time to the ruler and the gory mess that used to be an eagle. [Root.Monarch.GetName] can't really make anything out of it, it just seems like the aftermath of slicing and slamming the bird's body for a while. Attitudes change, however, as the Oracle's next sentence comes out: 'This is a dual blessing, from both Jupiter and Juno, at the same time. This predates the age of a great conqueror.'"
 oi_oracle.3.a: "My time to shine has come."

 oi_oracle.4.t: "Naval"
 oi_oracle.4.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] was unsure whether a bringing a fish was really a good choice. The Oracle had said it's as fine as most other animals, and that it's execution would still provide valuable signs. But [Root.Monarch.GetName] could not shrug off the thought that it seemed disrespectful, as, usually, the sacrifices are more gracious, majestic, or at least, cuter. Only one thing could dispell those thoughts, and it was the Oracle's proclamation following the evisceration. 'This fish was destined to be here' - the Oracle stated - 'It's no coincidence. Yamm himself has influenced your mind to bring it here. Which is a sign as much as these bowels are. You have Yamm in your side, and as long as that remains true, you'll dominate the seas of Atlantis.'"
 oi_oracle.4.a: "The unexpected good news are always the best ones."

 oi_oracle.5.t: "Nothing"
 oi_oracle.5.d: "Sweat drops dance around the face of the Oracle. For more minutes than is comfortable, the process of evisceration had yet to be finished. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s curiosity only kept growing, and expectations were high - either something really good or really bad was to happen. The Oracle's head tilted upwards, as words started to come out: 'Apologies for taking this long'. [Root.Monarch.GetName] immediately replied: 'Are you done? After this long, I suppose we have major news incoming?'. The Oracle smirked: 'Quite the contrary. Big signs are easily visible. The reason it took this long is because I couldn't find anything.' [Root.Monarch.GetName] was a bit surprised - the legendary Oracle couldn't find signs? Are the upcoming years no more than a blank slate?"
 oi_oracle.5.a: "Reality is often disappointing."
