 first_among_equals: "The First Among Equals"

 pearl_of_pacific: "Pearl of the Pacific"
 pearl_of_pacific_desc: "While our grand naval expeditions have discovered many islands and places, none have been as grand as the continent of Mu. Rich land, full of resources and ambition. We, truly, must be the blessed people to have found this great land."
 polynesian_war_armada: "Polynesian War Armada"
 polynesian_war_armada_desc: "We are, first and foremost, a maritime people and we must never lose this status to others who are intrested in absolute naval control of the pacific. This ocean belongs to our people and we need a grand navy to legitimize this, arrogant some would say, claim."
 warrior_class: "Promote the Warrior Class"
 warrior_class_desc: "Each individaul living on earth has an earthly purpose that has been given to him by the Gods themselves, if these people were not to follow their path, they would, in turn, disrupt the precedence of the sky and the earth and would disrespect the otherwordly wishes. With the rise of new, global, networks of diplomacy, we will need grander armies to protect our sovereignty."
 mana_sea: "Mana of the Sea"

 atlantis_group_ideas_bonus: "Atlantean (Group) Ambition"
 atla_gen_1: "A Forced Diversity"
 atla_gen_1_desc: "Multiple invasive foreign entities from our East have come to land and settle in Atlantean land. This has left us with a diversity that we knew not how to handle, hurting our lands with conflicts over faith. Time has mended this; while the scar remains, so does a valuable lesson in tolerance."
 atla_gen_2: "Greco-Roman Tactics"
 atla_gen_2_desc: "There is much that we have managed to learn from the tactics of the soldiers that landed here. We know not what happened to this Roman Empire they kept mentioning, but we know they were fierce warriors that didn't seem to know long-term defeats. Their tactics are a valuable addition to our martial knowledge."
 atla_gen_3: "Rites of April"
 atla_gen_3_desc: "For all in Atlantis, April is an important month. The Rites of April take almost half of the month, and festivities of all sorts are launched, with many celebrations for weeks on end. Even those who do not follow our religion, at this point, are culturally inclined to participare in the parties. Needless to say, this much celebration for this long a period means the rites are usually accompanied by multiple orgies."
 atla_gen_4: "Lessons of Phoenicia"
 atla_gen_4_desc: "One of the oldest invaders - and a comparitively lesser one in numbers - is the Phoenician group. They claim they were known for their impressive shipwrights and advanced docks. Perhaps listening to their advice might assist our navy's improvement."
 atla_gen_5: "Riches of the Trident"
 atla_gen_5_desc: "Atlantis is isolated from any other large landmasses, as the nearby sattlelite islands are too small. Atlantis is the queen of productivity in our vicinity, and our goods, common or exotic, are certain to attract many buyers."
 atla_gen_6: "Break the economic isolation"
 atla_gen_6_desc: "More peoples from the East have been making contact, from a land called Europa. We know not what their intentions are, but it seems they've made their wealth from trading far and out for the best goods all around the ocean. We could stand to learn from this. If anything, let's open up to their merchants."
 atla_gen_7: "Navy modernization"
 atla_gen_7_desc: "The European presence is making it increasingly clear that our navy is outdated and in need of a reform to keep up with the times. We never know when we'll need to defend ourselves, or perhaps project our influence outwards..."

 nautean_group_ideas_bonus: "Nautean Ambition"
 naut_gen_1: "Innovations from Atlantis"
 naut_gen_1_desc: "We might not like to admit it, but Atlantis usually knows how to handle advancements better than we do. We have to adapt, learning from them so that we might thrive as much as they once did."

The Rites of April take almost half of the month, and festivities of all sorts are launched, with many celebrations for weeks on end.

Needless to say, this much celebration for this long a period means the rites are usually accompanied by multiple orgies."
 naut_gen_4: "Defend our Autonomy!"
 naut_gen_4_desc: "Atlantis once influenced our islands to the point we had no control over our own fates. This has changed with time. We cannot let that happen ever again!"
 naut_gen_5: "Islands of cheap labor"
 naut_gen_5_desc: "Many of our inhabitants descend from slaves to some extent. For Atlanteans, us Nauteans have always been the cheap labor. At first, this might seem sad, but it shows our people's heart is grander, accepting the same tasks for lesser pay. More importantly, it makes it easier to pay the footmen!"
 naut_gen_6: "Break the economic isolation"
 naut_gen_6_desc: "More peoples from the East have been making contact, from a land called Europa. We know not what their intentions are, but it seems they've made their wealth from trading far and out for the best goods all around the ocean. We could stand to learn from this. If anything, let's open up to their merchants."
 naut_gen_7: "From the beach to the hills"
 naut_gen_7_desc: "Our archipelago's long beaches break into fairly sizeable hills as they go further inland. It might be hard to protect our direct coast, but we won't let that mean our end. We'll retreat to the hills if need be."

 meropis_ideas_bonus: "Meropian Ambition"
 meropis_1: "Ram into them if you have to!"
 meropis_1_desc: "We absolutely refuse the very idea of defeat against foreign navies, specially Atlantean ones. Our port authorities have been ordered to stab anyone who leaves a ship alive after a naval defeat. Our admirals and sailors will have to fight to the last, else they'll die when they dock anyway."
 meropis_2: "The soldiers of Machimos"
 meropis_2_desc: "Machimos is a highly belligerent town within our island. They're the epitome of soldier loyalty, and they'll certainly be of help in our wars."
 meropis_3: "Brains of Eusebes"
 meropis_3_desc: "If Machimos is known for the brawns, Eusebes is known for the brains. Skilled scholars reside there to fill in our pool of smarts."
 meropis_4: "Destroy the April Rites"
 meropis_4_desc: "We hate the month of April. Atlantis' love for their annual rites in that season makes it a disgusting, degenerate month full of the most despicable acts being done in that wretched hole of an island. It's our duty to ourselves to completely eradicate it by invading Atlantis and cracking down on them. Permanently."
 meropis_5: "Set Atlantis Alight"
 meropis_5_desc: "Why stop at the rites, anyway? All of Atlantis must burn, and that's non-negotiable."
 meropis_6: "From the Ashes of the Degenerates"
 meropis_6_desc: "As we burn down the states of the immoral island of Atlantis, we shall take the skeleton of that disgusting existence and turn it into a pillar for our own society to thrive. We will build an empire, far better than theirs! Not that it's much, anyway."
 meropis_7: "Enslave all survivors!"
 meropis_7_desc: "And any Atlanteans we find alive after we're done are going straight to work camps to bolster our economy!"
