 atla_gen_1_desc: "Multiple invasive foreign entities from our East have come to land and settle in Atlantean land.

If anything, let's open up to their merchants."
 atla_gen_7: "Navy modernization"
 atla_gen_7_desc: "The European presence is making it increasingly clear that our navy is outdated and in need of a reform to keep up with the times. We never know when we'll need to defend ourselves, or perhaps project our influence outwards..."
